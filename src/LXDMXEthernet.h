@class LXDMXEthernet
@abstract
   LXDMXEthernet encapsulates functionality for sending and receiving DMX over ethernet.
   It is a virtual class with concrete subclasses LXArtNet and LXSACN which specifically
   implement the Artistic Licence Art-Net and PLASA sACN 1.31 protocols.
   
   Note:  LXDMXEthernet_library requires
          Ethernet library used with the original Arduino Ethernet Shield
          For the Ethernet v2 shield, use the Ethernet2 Library.
          If the sketch compiles and loads correctly but there is no indication of packets
          being received, check to make sure the version of the Ethernet library matches
          that of your shield.
          
          For multicast, EthernetUdp.h/EthernetUdp2.cpp in the Ethernet/Ethernet2 library
          may need to be modified to add the beginMulticast method.
          See the code at the bottom of LXDMXEthernet.h

******************  multicast methods added to Ethernet2 library *******************

see  https://github.com/aallan/Arduino/blob/3811729f82ef05f3ae43341022e7b65a92d333a2/libraries/Ethernet/EthernetUdp.cpp

1) Locate the Ethernet (Etrhernet2) library in the IDE
   If you have installed the library, it will be located with other libraries in the <sketchbook>/libraries folder.
   If it is included in the IDE, you will need to search within the IDE files to find the libraries folder.
   On MacOS this is located at Arduino.app/Contents/Java/libraries.
   
2) If modifying the built-in library, duplicate the Ethernet library folder in your sketchbook folder
   (~/Documents/Arduino/libraries)  This will override the built-in library.  If you modify
   a built-in library directly, your changes will be lost if you later upgrade the IDE.
   
3)
   Add the required method as follows:

3A)  In EthernetUdph add the beginMulticast method declaration:
...
  EthernetUdp();  // Constructor
  virtual uint8_t begin(uint16_t);	// initialize, start listening on specified port. Returns 1 if successful, 0 if there are no sockets available to use
  uint8_t beginMulticast(IPAddress ip, uint16_t port);  //############## added to standard library
...

3B)  In EthernetUdp.cpp add the method body:

uint8_t EthernetUdp::beginMulticast(IPAddress ip, uint16_t port) {
    if (_sock != MAX_SOCK_NUM)
        return 0;
    
    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_SOCK_NUM; i++) {
        uint8_t s = w5500.readSnSR(i);
        if (s == SnSR::CLOSED || s == SnSR::FIN_WAIT) {
            _sock = i;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    if (_sock == MAX_SOCK_NUM)
        return 0;
    
    
    // Calculate MAC address from Multicast IP Address
    byte mac[] = {  0x01, 0x00, 0x5E, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00 };
    
    mac[3] = ip[1] & 0x7F;
    mac[4] = ip[2];
    mac[5] = ip[3];
    
    w5500.writeSnDIPR(_sock, rawIPAddress(ip));   //239.255.0.1
    w5500.writeSnDPORT(_sock, port);
    w5500.writeSnDHAR(_sock,mac);
    
    _remaining = 0;
    
    socket(_sock, SnMR::UDP, port, SnMR::MULTI);
    
    return 1;
}
